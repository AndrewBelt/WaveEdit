/* A portable library to create open and save dialogs on linux, osx and
 * windows.
 *
 * The library define a single function : noc_file_dialog_open.
 * With three different implementations.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * The library does not automatically select the implementation, you need to
 * define one of those macros before including this file:
 *
 *  NOC_FILE_DIALOG_GTK
 *  NOC_FILE_DIALOG_WIN32
 *  NOC_FILE_DIALOG_OSX

    NOC_FILE_DIALOG_OPEN    = 1 << 0,   // Create an open file dialog.
    NOC_FILE_DIALOG_SAVE    = 1 << 1,   // Create a save file dialog.
    NOC_FILE_DIALOG_DIR     = 1 << 2,   // Open a directory.

/* flags            : union of the NOC_FILE_DIALOG_XXX masks.
 * filters          : a list of strings separated by '\0' of the form:
 *                      "name1 reg1 name2 reg2 ..."
 *                    The last value is followed by two '\0'.  For example,
 *                    to filter png and jpeg files, you can use:
 *                      "png\0*.png\0jpeg\0*.jpeg\0"
 *                    You can also separate patterns with ';':
 *                      "jpeg\0*.jpg;*.jpeg\0"
 *                    Set to NULL for no filter.
 * default_path     : the default file to use or NULL.
 * default_name     : the default file name to use or NULL.
 *
 * The function return a C string.  There is no need to free it, as it is
 * managed by the library.  The string is valid until the next call to
 * no_dialog_open.  If the user canceled, the return value is NULL.
